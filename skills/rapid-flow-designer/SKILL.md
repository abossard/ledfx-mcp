description: Design rapid directional lighting scenes that read as lightning-bullet motion with controlled intensity. Use when creating high-velocity LED looks with scroll/scan carriers and safe duration/pacing constraints.

# Rapid Flow Designer

## Workflow
1. Pick a carrier effect: `scroll`, `scan`, or fast directional `wavelength`.
2. Set motion profile to high speed with tight rhythmic response.
3. Add depth layer (low-contrast gradient or dim color bed).
4. Add gate layer (reactive mask or short strobe accent).
5. Set short scene duration and space bullet scenes in playlists.

## Design Targets
- Perceived velocity: high and directional.
- Readability: preserve trajectory shape; avoid full-frame blur/noise.
- Impact windows: short bursts rather than sustained overload.

## Guardrails
- Keep bullet scenes around 9-12 seconds.
- Avoid long chains of bullet scenes.
- Use strobe as punctuation, not baseline carrier.
